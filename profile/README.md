# Web Application Design and Development

Welcome to the Web Application Design and Development (WADD) GitHub site.

This site contains all of the files you'll need for the practical classes on the module, each in its own git repository. Each class repository contains:

- The instructions for that class
- A template project that you can use to get started

The best way to access the projects is to copy them into your personal GitHub account as a repository and then clone this onto the computer you're working on. To do this, click the green "Use this template" button and follow the instructions GitHub provides.

If you're not familiar with git and GitHub, there's a tutorial available on the MPIE site at [this repository](https://github.com/UoY-IM-MPIE/mpie-git-tutorial).

To setup your first website and view it through git use the tutorial available at [this repository](https://github.com/IM-WADD/GitPages-Tutorial)
